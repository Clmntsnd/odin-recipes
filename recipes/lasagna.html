	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound spaghetti or other long pasta</li>
			<li>4 large eggs</li>
			<li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 pound pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>4 teaspoons Diamond kosher salt, for the pasta water, plus more to taste as needed</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, according to the package instructions</li>
			<li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until crispy and browned, stirring occasionally, about 8-10 minutes. If using garlic, add it to the pan in the last minute of cooking.</li>
			<li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper until well combined.</li>
			<li>When the pasta is done, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot.</li>
			<li>Add the cooked pancetta (and garlic, if using) to the pasta and toss to combine.</li>
			<li>Immediately pour the egg mixture over the pasta and toss quickly and vigorously to coat the pasta in the sauce. The heat from the pasta and pancetta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
			<li>Serve the pasta carbonara hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
		</ol>
		<p><em>Note : Be sure to work quickly when tossing the pasta with the egg mixture to prevent the eggs from scrambling.</em></p>
