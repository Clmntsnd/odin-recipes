	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound lasagna noodles</li>
			<li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
			<li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
			<li>1 onion, diced</li>
			<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flake (optional)</li>
			<li>1 container of riccota cheese (15 ounce)</li>
			<li>2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
			<li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
			<li>While the noodles are cooking, make the meat sauce. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and cook the ground beef or Italian sausage until browned and cooked through, breaking up any large chunks with a wooden spoon. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
			<li>Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the meat and cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Add the basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Stir in the marinara sauce and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
			<li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of the grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
			<li>To assemble the lasagna, spoon a thin layer of the meat sauce into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat these layers until all of the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
			<li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges of the noodles are slightly crispy.</li>
			<li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
