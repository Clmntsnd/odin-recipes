	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
			<li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
			<li>8-10 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
			<li>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes (if using) and cook, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant and just starting to turn golden brown, about 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
			<li>When the spaghetti is done, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and return it to the pot.</li>
			<li>Add the garlic-infused olive oil to the spaghetti and toss to combine. If the spaghetti seems a bit dry, add some of the reserved pasta water to help loosen it up</li>
			<li>Add the chopped parsley to the spaghetti and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
			<li>Serve the spaghetti aglio e olio hot, garnished with additional chopped parsley and red pepper flakes, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
